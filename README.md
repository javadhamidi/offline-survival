# Offline Survival

A short choose-your-own-adventure style text adventure mashed up with trivia based on [ligi](https://github.com/ligi)'s [Survival Manual](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual).

My first real java based project made in greenfoot, as part of a school assignment. Project was made from scratch and had to be completed over only a couple weeks so it's a bit rough around the edges. All art was drawn in Aseprite and story was written using Twine.
