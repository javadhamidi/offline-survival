you discover an ubrupt engine faluire
and are forced to make a quick emergency
landing. Turns out a flock a birds flew
into your wind turbines, completely
destroying any form of propulsion. You
salvage what you can: a bottle of water,
some canned food, a knife

It will be a couple days before anyone
comes looking for you and it doesn&#39;t
look like your going anywhere. Perhaps
its best you start looking for shelter.

[[Continue-&gt;Day 1: Finding Shelter]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Day 1: Finding Shelter" tags="" position="303,15" size="200,100">Standing next to the wreckage of your
plane, you decided to spend the rest of
day experimenting with different shelter
sites until you find the ideal choice.
No matter what you will find a solution,
but with limited energy you&#39;ll need to do
it as quickly as possible. Let&#39;s begin.

[[Continue-&gt;Natural Shelter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Day 2: Water Procurement" tags="" position="539,12" size="200,100">Clearly your next greatest proirity is obtaining a water supply, as the single water bottle you brought with you will not last. Upon surveying the area, you observe three possible paths in the that may potentially hold fresh water. Which do you take?

[[Invesigate a broken down tinny on the island shore.-&gt;A Broken Down Tinny]]
[[Go towards the lush vegetation and swarming insects in the distance.-&gt;Vegetation and Insects]]
[[Explore a nearby cave.-&gt;The Cave]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Day 3: Cold Weather" tags="" position="926,132" size="200,100">sample text

[[sample-&gt;sample]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="A Broken Down Tinny" tags="" position="790,13" size="100,100">You approach the small boat to find it quite empty. Clearly someone else has once suffered the same fate as you. All that is left is a half empty bottle of beer.

Do you take the drink?

[[Drink the Beer.-&gt;A Swig of Beer]]
[[Leave it on the boat.-&gt;Empty Handed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Vegetation and Insects" tags="5" position="529,128" size="100,100">Good choice! Plants, insects, birds and animal tracks can all indicate the presence of a water source. After a few minutes you approach a fresh water stream. Hydrate Up!

[[Continue-&gt;Water or Ice]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="The Cave" tags="-100" position="915,13" size="100,100">This was a bad idea. As you walk deeper into the cave you notice that it begins to rain outside. The cave begins flood. You are trapped.
[[Continue-&gt;Game Over]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="A Swig of Beer" tags="-10" position="786,129" size="100,100">Bad move. The drink had clearly made you feel even more thirsty, not to mention a little woozy. This will be a long walk home.
[[Continue-&gt;Empty Handed]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Game Over" tags="" position="1152,17" size="200,200">Game Over

... You drowned in the cave
...</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Water or Ice" tags="" position="526,237" size="100,100">How strange!? Not only do you find a stream of flowing fresh water, but some ice along its banks. What do you think: should you try eating the ice, or just drink the water?

[[Collect some ice-&gt;Ice?]]
[[Take some water-&gt;Water!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Empty Handed" tags="" position="662,128" size="100,100">With nothing left to see, you return to the shelter empty handed with no more water and much less energy. However, there&#39;s still plenty of time in day.

[[Inspect the vegetation and swarming insects in the distance.-&gt;Vegetation and Insects]]
[[Explore a nearby cave.-&gt;The Cave]]
[[Rest (continue to Day 3)-&gt;Day 3: Cold Weather]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Ice?" tags="-2" position="665,235" size="100,100">Probably not the best idea. Eating ice can reduce body temperature and lead to more dehydration. Certainly you can feel those effects. You try drinking more water instead, and collect some to take home. You return to the shelter.

[[Continue-&gt;Day 3: Cold Weather]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Water!" tags="5" position="785,237" size="100,100">Ahh, that really hits the spot. Your feeling better already! You collect some water to take back to the shelter.

[[Continue-&gt;Day 3: Cold Weather]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Natural Shelter" tags="" position="50,13" size="100,100">You don&#39;t overlook the potential of the natural formations around you that could provide shelter. These seem like viable options, but which one is best?

[[A low ground ravine-&gt;Too cold!]]
[[A large trees with low-hanging limbs-&gt;Where else?]]
[[A dry creek bed-&gt;Too cold!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="How Big?" tags="5" position="43,246" size="100,100">Sounds good! Now that you&#39;ve looked at some potential shelter options, how big do you think your shelter should really be?

[[Enough room to fit half your body
[[Just enough for you to lie down comfortably
[[Enough room to comfortably move around</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Where else?" tags="+5" position="51,129" size="100,100">Sounds good, although you can probably manage constructing something better out of the material availabe. Where else do you think would be suitable?

[[An area near a lake below the high-water mark-&gt;Flooding!?]]
[[An area free from insects, reptiles, and poisonous plants-&gt;How Big?]]
[[A flash flood area-&gt;Flooding!?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Flooding!?" tags="-5" position="183,133" size="100,100">Bad idea. You don&#39;t want to spend the rest of your time on this island worring about your shelter being flooded. You decide any area free from insects, reptiles, and poisonous plants sounds good to you. 

Now that you&#39;ve looked at some potential shelter options, how big do you think your shelter should really be?

[[Enough room to fit half your body-&gt;Aadequate Protection
[[Just enough for you to lie down comfortably
[[Enough room to comfortably move around-&gt;Aadequate Protection</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Too cold!" tags="-5" position="184,17" size="100,100">Probably not. Low areas collect cold air, while warm air rises, and staying warm is one of your biggest concerns. A	large trees with low-hanging limbs seems better. Where else do you think would be suitable?

[[An area near a lake below the high-water mark-&gt;Flooding!?]]
[[An area free from insects, reptiles, and poisonous plants-&gt;How Big?]]
[[A flash flood area-&gt;Flooding!?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="End of Day 1" tags="" position="186,364" size="100,100">From some trial and error, you decide to spend the rest of the day buiding a debris hut, for its warmth and ease of construction. By nightfall you&#39;re complete. Better get some rest, you have plenty of scavenging to do tommorrow.

[[Continue to Day 2-&gt;Day 2: Water Procurement]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Aadequate Protection" tags="-5" position="180,251" size="100,100">Not quite. A shelter must be large enough to protect you and small enough to contain your body heat. Somewhere in between would be best. That said, you have a pretty good idea of what you want your shelter to look like now.

[[Continue-&gt;End of Day 1]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Just right" tags="5" position="44,361" size="100,100">Good choice. Your shelter must be large enough to protect you, but small enough to contain your body heat, so it should be just enough for you to lie down comfortably in. Seems like you have a pretty good idea of what your shelter should be like.
