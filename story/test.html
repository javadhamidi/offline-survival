you discover an ubrupt engine faluire
and are forced to make a quick emergency
landing. Turns out a flock a birds flew
into your wind turbines, completely
destroying any form of propulsion. You
salvage what you can: a bottle of water,
some canned food, a knife

It will be a couple days before anyone
comes looking for you and it doesn&#39;t

observe three possible paths in the
that may potentially hold fresh water.
Which do you take?
