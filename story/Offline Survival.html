Turns out a flock a birds flew into your wind turbines, completely destroying any form of propulsion. You salvage what you can: a bottle of water, some canned food, a knife

It will be a couple days before anyone comes looking for you and it doesn&#39;t look like your going anywhere. Perhaps its best you start looking for shelter.

Upon surveying the area, you notice three paths in the distance that seem promising to holding fresh water. Which do you take?

Clearly someone else has once suffered the same fate as you. All that is left is a half empty bottle of beer. 

Do you take the drink?

[[Drink the Beer.-&gt;A Swig of Beer]]
[[Leave it on the boat.-&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Vegetation and Insects" tags="" position="529,128" size="100,100">Good choice! Plants, insects, birds and animal tracks can all indicate the presence of a water source. After a few minutes you approach a fresh water stream. Hydrate Up!

[[Continue-&gt;Water or Ice]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="The Cave" tags="" position="915,13" size="100,100">This was a bad idea. As you walk deeper into the cave you notice that it begins to rain outside. The cave begins flood. You are trapped.

Not only do you find a stream of flowing fresh water, but some ice along its banks. You take a drink. Now you just have to consider what to take back to your shelter to hold on to.

[[Collect some ice-&gt;
[[Take some water-&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Empty Handed" tags="" position="664,130" size="100,100">With nothing left to see, you return to the shelter empty handed with no more water and much less energy. However, there&#39;s still plenty of time in day.
